## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a **retail sales data warehouse** using PostgreSQL.  
The warehouse is structured using **dimensional modeling (star schema)** to support structured reporting and analytical queries for sales performance analysis across time, products, and locations.

---

## 🎯 Business Task
The objective of this project is to:
- Organize retail sales data into a structured data warehouse
- Enable efficient analysis of sales performance
- Support reporting across multiple dimensions such as time, product, and city
- Demonstrate analytical SQL capabilities used in business intelligence scenarios

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Detail
- The dataset is **synthetically generated** for learning and portfolio purposes
- Data is provided in **CSV format**
- Includes:
  - Date-related attributes
  - Product information
  - City-level customer segmentation
  - Sales transactions (price and quantity)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **SQL**
- **PostgreSQL**

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Dimensional modeling (Star Schema)
- Fact and dimension table design
- Data loading from CSV files
- Advanced SQL aggregations
  - GROUPING SETS
  - ROLLUP
  - CUBE
  - Materialized views
  
---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. **Schema Design**
   - Designed a star schema with fact and dimension tables
   - Identified appropriate granularity for sales analysis

2. **Database Setup**
   - Created a PostgreSQL database
   - Defined dimension and fact tables using SQL DDL

3. **Data Loading**
   - Imported CSV datasets into PostgreSQL tables
   - Validated data integrity and structure

4. **Analytical Querying**
   - Wrote aggregation queries using GROUPING SETS, ROLLUP, and CUBE
   - Generated multi-level sales summaries

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Created a materialized view to store precomputed maximum sales metrics

6. **Result Documentation**
   - Captured query outputs as images
   - Organized results for clear presentation
